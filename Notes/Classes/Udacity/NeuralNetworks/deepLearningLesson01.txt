- logistic classifier (linear classifier)
  - W * X + b = y
    - so Weight * <input matrix> + bias = <output prediction>
    - machine learnign will build the W and bias
    - use softmax equation to tuen scroes into probabilities that sum t 1
      - so for 3 letters, get 3 probabilties that sum to one, with only one possible outscome for the predicted letter
      -> S(yi) = exp(yi) / SUMover-i[ exp(yi) ]
      -> so [2.0, 1.0, 0.1] scores becomes [0.7, 0.2, 0.1] probabilties
      
    - def softmax(x):
        return np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x), axis = 0)
