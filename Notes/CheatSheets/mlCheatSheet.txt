NN layers:
----------
  - pooling
    - used to reduce data for better compute performance
    
  - transfer learning
    - repurpose model from similar problem, retrining last fully connected layer
    

Optimizers:
-----------
  - gradient descent
    - need scaled data, sensitive to size (see time seried vid 20200124)

Problems:
---------
  - time series
    - missing relaced by 0 or mean can create spikes (use pd.ffil() or pd.interpolate)
    
Models:
-------
  - LSTM: long short term memory
  - GRU: gated recurring units
  - RNN
    - good for sequence predictions, but suffer from short term memory (gradient shrinks as back propogated through layers)
  
Functions:
-----------
  - tanh: good for keeping values between -1/1, and keeping loss down as progress through network
    - regulates data as passed through network
  - sigmoid: similar to tan, but squshes between 0/1
    - can help ltsm determine what data to pass (1) and what to forget (0)
