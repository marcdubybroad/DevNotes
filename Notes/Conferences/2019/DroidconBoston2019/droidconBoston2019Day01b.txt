2019008 - 1400 - test driven development that lasts
- red-green-refactor
- why tests
  - help write good code
  - good documentation for the code
  - confident refactoing
  
- what challenges
  - legacy code
  - takes time, but it is an investment that will save you time in the future
  - bad tests are worse than no tests
    - time znd effort wasted without results
  -
  
- tools
  - test doubles (mocks or emulator)
    - dummies; like placeholders, fills in paraeters
    - stubs: returned pre defined data
    - fakes: closer to real implmentation from stubs
      - more involved to create
      - supports sam opretations
    - mocks
      - Mockito, PowerMock
      -
    - spies
      - hybrid between stub, fake and mock
      - as real as stubs, but have ability to record interactions like mock
      
- tests are maintanable when
  - old tests don't break often
  - old tests are easy to update
  - easy to add new tests
  
- how to write maintainable tests
  - use good test specification system
    - flow
      - given dependency or behavior
      - when we act on the scenario
      - assert that the expected behavior happens
  - test behavior, not implementation details
    - test that you got the right data, not whethr it came from the cache at the same time
    - can add other test to make sure data is cached
  - for objects thta do not return any value, using mocks might be easier?
  
  - assert/verify only one thing per test
    - makes it eaiser to know what made the test fail
    - usually when you write test description, if you use the word 'and', you are here
  
  - use descriptive test names
    - from test name, should know why test failed
      - not from the stack grace
    - kotlin allows to bck ticks in test names with spaces
    - junit5 has @DisplayName annotation
      - this is what is dislayed in the consile when running the test
      
- tips
  - shy away from having logic in the test
    - makes it brittle
    - avoid if, for loops
  - avoid abtsractions in tests
