20190408 - 1500 - testing legacy code
- works at vodafone
- from zero coverage to automated testing

- architecture is important

- how to resolve framework dependencies
  - abstracted out all android classes, use own runtime
  - for internal db, inject your your won
  - can also extend the tested class
    - if all setting is done in methods, then can override these in the test class
    
  - for abtsracting access to android framework
    - can use own runtime for the tests as opposed to the android framework
    - the new runtime would have expected results
    
- how to use this in junit
  - oerride te testrule
    - so have: public class EnvironmentRule implements TestRule
    
- revise static calls
  - make internal pieces non static objects
  - can then test the obects individually
  
  
- code structure
  - look at the code and indentations
    - the bulet method, where little indentation
    - zigzag method, which is nested if method
      - makes testing com0licated since there are many states in nested if methods

  - remove unused code

20190408 - 1400 - test driven development that lasts
- red-green-refactor
- why tests
  - help write good code
  - good documentation for the code
  - confident refactoring
  
- what challenges
  - legacy code
  - takes time, but it is an investment that will save you time in the future
  - bad tests are worse than no tests
    - time and effort wasted without results
  -
  
- tools
  - test doubles (mocks or emulator)
    - dummies; like placeholders, fills in parameters
    - stubs: returned pre defined data
    - fakes: closer to real implmentation from stubs
      - more involved to create
      - supports same operations; so dao would have same methods but use list as storage medium
    - mocks
      - Mockito, PowerMock
      -
    - spies
      - hybrid between stub, fake and mock
      - as real as stubs, but have ability to record interactions like mock
      
- tests are maintanable when
  - old tests don't break often
  - old tests are easy to update
  - easy to add new tests
  
- how to write maintainable tests
  - use good test specification system
    - flow
      - given dependency or behavior
      - when we act on the scenario
      - assert that the expected behavior happens
  - test behavior, not implementation details
    - test just that you got the right data, not whether it came from the cache at the same time
    - can add other test to make sure data is cached
  - for objects that do not return any value, using mocks might be easier?
  
  - assert/verify only one thing per test
    - makes it easier to know what made the test fail
    - usually when you write test description, if you use the word 'and', you are here (are testing too much)
  
  - use descriptive test names
    - from test name, should know why test failed
      - not from the stack trace
    - kotlin allows to have back ticks in test names with spaces
      - good for descriptive names for tests
    - junit5 has @DisplayName annotation
      - this is what is dislayed in the console when running the test
      
- tips
  - shy away from having logic in the test
    - makes it brittle
    - avoid if, for loops
  - avoid abstractions in tests
  - be generous with comments
  - use parameterized tests
    - junit parameter library for junit
  - resources
    - testing on the toilet
    - why devs write bad tests
    - marting fowler
    -
  - uncle bob webinar
    - create test, then hit alt-enter and have IDE create class
    - create test method, alt0enter and have IDE create the method
