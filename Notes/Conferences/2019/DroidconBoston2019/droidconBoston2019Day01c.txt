- build, test, ship and learn regularly and on the cloud

- DevOps with AppCenter
  - appcenter.ms

- ideas
  - time based rnn
    - time based
    - trying to determine how gd based on stroke
    - compare to old
    - can predict how the speed will update
    - can also classify, softmax
    



20190408 - 1630 - RxJava
- fully reactive apps
- pograming with asyc data ste=reams

- benefits fo reactive programming
  - keeps data up to date
  - unifies async and sync
  - represents more hinest modeling of your apps
  
- click listening is a form of reactive orogramming

most use of rxJava
  - network
  - async tasks
  - database access
  
- LivaData vs RxJava

- turn user input into a Subject (kotlin or RxJava class?)




20190408 - 1600 - solving the hrd problems
- works at wb digital labs as android engineer

- case study
  - XOR obsfucation
    - exclusive or, only okne is true for true
    - properties
      - commutative
      - symmetrical
      - cyclic key
    - easy to encrypt and decrypt
      - a quick brown fox
      - XOR abcabcabcabcabc
      - kasdhaskjhdjhkjljjl
      - XOR abcabcabcabcabc
      - a quick brown fox

- finding the spurce of the problem
  - what is the silliest problem it could be?
  - chat to coworkers
    - while explaining, can think thrpugh issue
    - can also help to challenge your assumptions
    - can also take a break, do something physical
      - subconscious might be working on it
  - log everything
    - if use Timber, use the tag method
    - also overlog
      - easier to filter things out in the ide
  - can also change breakpoints to only suspend on a condition
    - can add logging in the break point as well
    - right click break point
    
- what the problem was
  - BitmapFactory, using InputStream to create image
  - BitMap objects has a header in the file tat has information about the bitmap
  
  
- learn from mistakes
  - keep a list of past offenders
    - ie: implementation overrides
    - ie: pending intents
    - ie: date and time zone related
    - ie: val get() vs fun
  - understand the cause
  
  
    
    
- notes
  - pending intent, if the extras are different, will not look different to the android device
    - so replace pending intent that might be there acidentally
