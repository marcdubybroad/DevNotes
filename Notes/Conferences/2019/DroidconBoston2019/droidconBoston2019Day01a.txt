    - so need to make a quick impression -> better design

    - companies that do better design do 2x better on stock market
      - design links
        - https://design.google
        - Design Is
        - stanford d school: design thinking
          - but no back arrows on design process flow chart, very forward linear way

    - navigation editor for storyboarding
    - motion editor
      - with keyframes to specify intermittent states
    - themes from material design  
    - sketch
      - not great for quick iteration, since can't easily convert to android right away
    - communuity libs
      - must have open source libs

    - LiveData
      -> look into two way data binding (new?)
    - ViewModel
      - can now survive after a destroy
      - very new feature
      -
  - sharing data between fragments
  - room persistence library
  -> print out arch guiding principles
  - use coin for dependency injection
  
    
  
- look into
  - book: art and fear, bayles and Orland

  - in god we trust, everyone bring data
  
  - tom li
    - 50k a day -> 5k and hour -> 10mil a year
    
        

20190408 - 1100 - navigation (++++*)
- new navigation arch component
  - helps with bundle adding
    - with bundles, no guarantee that a bundle key will have been populated
  - for action, can add default values going to parameters
    
  - NavHostFragment initialization
    - create NavController
    - registers fragment as destination type
    - restore navigation state
    - set graph to NavController
    - navigate to first destination
    
  - safe argument passing
    - add 'android.arch.navigation...' plugin
    - then define <argument ...> tag in the destination fragment
    
    - Directions class vs Destinations class?
    
  - conditional navigation
    -
    
  - deep link
    - have a <deepLink ...> element in the fragment definition
    - need to add <nav-graph ...> element in the manifest for that fregment/action
    
  - testing navigation
    - mock the nav controller
      - ie: Mockito
    - can launch fragments outside activity
      - parameterize fragment that you want to launch
      - launch it in a container with an optional bundle
      - method: .launchFragmentInContainer(Bundle bundle)
      
  - single activity
    - why?
      - shared lifecycle aware scope
      - fragments lighter and first class support
      - but watch out for multi module
      - look at Ian Lake talk at devsummit 2018
    - arch
      - move all logic for that screen into the fragment out of the activity
      - leave activity to be navigation related logic
    - for shared element in single activity app
      - look at the NavigationExtras object/parameter
