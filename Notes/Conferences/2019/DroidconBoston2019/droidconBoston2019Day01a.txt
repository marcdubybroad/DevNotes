- new navigation arch component
  - hrps with bundle adding
    - with bundles, no guarantee that a bundle key will have been populated
  - for action, can add default values going to parameters
    
  - NavHostFragment initialization
    - create NavController
    - registers fragment as destination type
    - restore navigatino state
    - set graph to NavController
    - navigate to first destination
    
  - safe argument passing
    - add 'android'arch'navigation...' plugin
    - then define <argument ...> tag in the destination fragment
    
    - Directions class vs Destinations class?
    
  - conditionall navigation
    -
    
  - deep link
    - have a <deepLink ...> element in the fragent definition
    - need to add <nav-graph ...> element in the manifest for that fregment/action
    
  - testing navigaytion
    - mock the nav controller
      - ie: Mockito
    - can launch fragments outside activity
      - parameterize fragmemt that you want to launch
      - launch it in a container with an optional bundle
      - method: .launchFragmentInContainer(Bundle bundle)
      
  - single activity
    - why?
      - shared lifecycle awarae scope
      - fragents lighter and first class support
      - but watch out for multi module
      - look at Ian Lake talk and devsummit 2018
    - arch
      - move all logic ffor that screen into the fragment
      - leave activity to be navigation related logic
    - for shared element in ingle activity app
      - look at the NavigationExtras object/parameter
