- erik haddad, @erikhaddad, firebase UX engineer

- deductive nd inductive learning
  - deductive -> given rules
  - inductive -> get the ules from the data
  
- why on device
  - no net latency
  - no network needed
  - no need to encrypt
  - no provacy issues
  
- TF born on 11 2015

- photo light controlled by
  - shutter speed
  - aperture
  - ISO

- face detection
  - face tracking
    - array of 133 points
  - landmark
  - contour
  - classification
  
  
- NLP
  - helps with double meaning of words'
  - 2 new features just released
    - smart reply, uses previous 10 messages in the conversation
      - all o device
    - language detection
      - language identification api
  
  
- custom models
  - briging oen tf lite models to ML kit
  - firebase hlps with model hosting of your own models
  - convert your model to tf lite
  
- transfer learning
  - reuse existing model trained on related tasks
  - trains new classifier
  - no need to alter lower layers

20190409 - 1500 - unconference
- Siamak Ashfari
  - @biocodes
  - zoewave.com
  
- rxJava quick talk, nick galbraith
  - 100 operatorss, very few used
    - most people use 5
  - reactive streams
  - functional programming
  - negatives
    - big learning curve
    - using operators without understanding how they work
    
  - new alternatives, kotlin coroutines
  - why coroutines
    - first class support
    - kotlin first
    - no transposing data
  - resouces
    - android suspenders (and dev summit 18)
    - using kotlin coroutines in android
    - ledair
    
    
- making build process painless, blue apron dev, @tmtrademark
  - let stakeholders know when they will be
  - builds need to be stable
  - highly automated
    - ideally helps to know when to release a buold, nt how
  - least code latency
    - reduce time between code checked in to when it is deployed to prod
    - if code sits without being deployed, then 
  
  - blue apron case
    - do 1 week releases
    - make sure master is always stable
      - lots of automated tests on code
    - automated releases
      - use circle and vaseline
      - invest with CI
  - conclusion
    - make relase schedul predictable
    - process predictable
    - code latency
    - allow builds to soak to improve quality
    - get builds in the hands of people asap, so automate
    
    
- using kotlojn coroutines for bluetooth LE, travis wyatt, Juul
  - basic bluetooth process
    - discover device
    - connect device
    - communicate using BluetootGatt object
      - bluetoothDevice.connectGatt

  - using kotlin coroutines
    - developped ABLE library
      - Android Bluetooth Low Energy
    - com.juul.able.*
