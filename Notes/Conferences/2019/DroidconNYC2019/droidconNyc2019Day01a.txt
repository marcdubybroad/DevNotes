  - pomodoro technique
    - 3 simple steps (down from the original 6 steps)
      - step 1: decide what you are going to work n
      - step 2: work on that task and that task only
        - recommended amount of time is 25 mins
      - stape 3: take break
        - first iteration, 5 mins
        - if have doen multiple iterations (recommended 4), take 30 min break
          - then check email, slack
          - breaks help doing offline processing in cortex

  - to do lists
    - the urgent is seldomly important
      - also the important is seldmly urgert
    - break down into quadrants
      - must fix, urg + imp
        - must fix
      - imp but not urg
        - spend 25 mins on
      - urg but not imp
        - delegate, can start building tdd for future use
      - not urg, not imp
        - spend break on

  - to dos
    - problem: avoid small interruptions
      - relics of synchronous communications (phone, chat, physical chats)
      - solution: work like everyone is remote
        - no more shpulder tapping
        - assume you'll get answer when they have time, not you
        - write everything down
          - self documenting
        - enables more quiet voices on the team
      - write heartbeats and kickoffs
    - problem: avoid major interruptions
      - avoid meetings
      - guaranteed to havi ng too any people
        - because people hate to be excluded
        - organizers don't want to allienate anyone
      - meetings usually go over
      - information inbalance
        - everybody has different data points or
      - they sawn more memetings
      - they are scheduled interruptions
      - solution:
        - try not having any
          - do we really need this meeting
          - can this be donw in written format
        - 3 person rule
        - plan your escape to get out of meetings
    - problem: avoid chat
      - chat is treated like required reading
      - solution:
        - start to remove expectatiom that chat is required reading
        - use a slower gear
          - high gear: meetings, chat, shoulder tap
          - lower gear: email, google docs
          
    - problem: preventing overwork
      - better balance makes you better at work
      - solve problems in down time as background process works
      - empathy is built away from work
      - solution: 40 hours a week is fine
        - 1/2 of waking hours are at work
        - spend 20 hours on avg with family, which is 1/2 time with workers
        - hours != productivity
          - brain tires out like a muscle
          - you are actually worse after 40 hours
      - solution: cnfirne work to work hours
        - establish ground rules
      - solution: establish a channel for true emergencies
        - don't conflate 2 channels with different urgent tasks
      - solution: coach rule breakers
      - solutions; take an actuall vacations
        - don't contact people on vacatiojns
        
    - forget myth that you always have to be learning
      - ok to give yourself a break
      
    - problem: shaping up your projects
      - stop running in circls and ship work that matters (book)
      - solution:
        - work in 6 week cycles
        - learn to manage tension between time, quality and scope
        - good is realtive
          - perfect is the enemy of good
        - trust in autonomy
          - commitment not consensus
        - no backlogs
        
    - problem: is this possible
      - solution:
        - start changing your own situation
        - shit happens
        
- books
  - it doesn't have to be crazy at work
