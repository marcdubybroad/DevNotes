- 13:10 - presto talk
  - no storage in presto, but comminicates with DBs
    - mysql, snowflake, hadoop, oracle, mongodb, teradata, bigquery, s3
    
  - created at facebook
  - the more workers you add, the more horsepower you add to the system
  
  - can write your own connector if you want
  
  - apache hive connector
  
  - hive
    - sql engine dev before presto
    - used map reduce jobs
    - 3 parts
      - how data stored on disk
      - data catalog
      - execution engine
    - first 2 used by presto
      - presto integrates easily with hive
      
  - relational database connector
    -  mysql, oracle, bigquery,
    
  - no relatinal data sources
    - cassandra, elasticsearch, kafka, redis, mongodb
    
  - kubernetes (greek word for a pilot)
    - container orchestration
    - k8s (shorthand)
    
    
- 13:50 - ML with open source infrastructure
  - open data hub
    - could agnostic, can run wherever you can run open shift
      - open shift is a container orchestration engine
      
  - RH tech
    - RH data grid, in mem storage option
    - RH ai library (has ML tools)
    - AI center of excellence
    
    
  - k-means
    - clustring for recommendation engine
      - if like Avengers, might like Dark Knight
      - use elbow method to find k that works
      
      
      from sklearn.feature_xtraction.text imprt TfldVectorizer
      from sklearn.cluts
      
- 14:40 - ML pipelines with kubeflow, argo, open data hub

  - pipeline
    - ingest layer that does capture and transformation of data
    - distribute data to use model dev techs
    - evaluate the models
    - find the best model
    - push to production and monitor
    
  - pipleine attributes
    - automation
    - repeatability
    - artifact passing (input, utpu)
    - triggers
    - multi cluster
    
  - steps, or DAG features
    - targets
    - parallel processing
    - conditionals
    - loops
    - pause.resume
    - timeouts
    - retries
    
  - airflow
    - dag workflow orchestrator
    - python based
    
    
    
- 15:30 - mlflow
  - intro to k nearest neighbr and k-means algorithms
  - try to tune hyper parameters using mlflow
    - try differnet k's, each in its own containers
    - mlflow tracks each container
