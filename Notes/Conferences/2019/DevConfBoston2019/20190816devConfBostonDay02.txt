- 09:50 - AI for devs and qa
  - how for qe and dev to use ML tools for their work, as opposed to just develop them
  
  - cluster logs based on certain characeristics
  
  - models
    - correlation analysis
    - flake clustering
    - duplicate bug detection
      - condenses bug into similarity measures
      - matches to cluster
      
  - future plans
    - open data hub, opendatahub.io
    - ai library, gitlab.com/opendatahub/ai-library
  - other plans
    - argo to handle modeling
    - model runner
    - dashboard
    
    
- 11:00 - kafka
  - distributed streaming platform
    - not just a platform that does streaming and is distributed
    - can alo proces records and events
      - also offers storage and persistence capabilties
      
  - databases
    - cannot handle huge amounts of data (30 terrabytes)
    - databases annot handle analytics and transactions at the same time
    - databases cannot hanlde throughput
    
    
  - hadoop
    - solves one proble in particular, large volume
    - put data into hdfs
    
  - messaging
     - ie
        - active mq
        - qpid
        - bitria
        - rabbitmq
        - amazon sqs
    - proble, can't process the data as it is moving through the pipes
    
  - kafka 3 pillars
    - messaging done right
      - streams are tables that continuously received data
      
    - scalable data pipelines
    - stream processing
    
    
  - 3 constant processes in IT (another day, another doug)
    - people creating another language every day
    - people cteating a new JS framework every day
    - people creating new databases every day
    
    
- 13:10 - TF on open shift
  - helping solve ML workflow
  
  - using kube flow
  
  - use reusable kube flow coponnents
  
  - open shoft
    - can take source code and package into deployable binary
      - java -> make jar artifact -> executed in app image
      
  - tensor flow serving
    - high performance seving meachnism int he TF ecosystem
      - if ise, look at tesnflow-servive-s2i templates
      
      
  - thoth
    - AI based tool to analyze softare stacks
      - also provide customized ai contaners
      - look at github.com
      - helps with making sure your TF downloaded has been compled ioptimally for the chip arch using
      
      
  - github.com/AICoE/tensorflow-wheels
  
  - recommendations
    - use containers
    - use RHEL containers -> get optimized TF stack
    - use s2i
    - open shift for ML workflow
    
    
- 14:00 - NLP for sentiment analysis

  - approachds
    - lexicon based aproach
    - ML approach
      - train ML model, classify
    - DL based approach
      -
      
  - 3 core librrirw
    - s-nlp
    - vader
      - sentimemtn mainly aimed toward social media interactions
      - feed specific terms into the lexicon
    - textblob
    
      
  - used RNN with LTSM layers
  - BRET - bi directional encoder representation from transformers
    - semi supervised learning on large amounts of text
    - then supervised training on a specific task with transfer learning
    
  - what makes bert different
    - contextual represenation
    - deeply bidirectional unsupervised language re[presentation
    - models relationahsips between sentences
    - transformwer architecture
      - compared to RNN which is very sequential
      - can take better advantage of TPUs for better performance
      
      
      
- 14:50 - data science in the open clud exchange model
  - good of corporate clouds (aws, azure, gce)
    - but negatives
      - lock in, data gravity
      - users of OSS, but don't give back
      
  - mass open cloud intiative
    
  - so share some private cloud resources into a pool
    - earn credits when you don't use all your resources and donate cycles to cloud
    - use those earned credits when need them
