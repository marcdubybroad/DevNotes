    - different than cypherQL
  - 76 of fortune 100 using neo4j

- 1015 - BAC fraud detection
  - look into mind maps (tree)
  - scenarios
    - victims sell online (leasing apartemets), fraudsters pretend to overpay (by askign bank for provisional credit), fraudsters convince victims to repay surplus amount
      - farud gets vitim bank info for deposito
      - call bank, impersoant customer, say atm not working, get bank to issue $3k provisional credit
      - call vistim back and say paid $3k instead of $300, get reimbursed through venmo
    - credit card busto out
      - max out credit card, then pay off with fraudulent check, has $0 balance temporarily, max out a second time
        - end up with card maxed out 2x

  - triadic closure
    - small triange graph of 3 friends
  - 3 emperors league network (austria, germany, russia)
  - graph partitioning

- 1200 - enterprise graph strategy, EY guy
  - what is a graphy problem
    - queries hitting more than 5 tables;
    - self join tables (recursion)
    - has complex hierarchies (1 to many,, many to many)
    - deands fast query results
  - apoc package (proof of concept)
    - load csv files\
      - can handle compressed csv files
      - load csv with headers from "file:///movies.csv" as row
      - call apoc.load()
  - arch
    - node lables define set members
    - faster to search along relationships (traversal) than properties (full graph scan)
  - call db.schema()
  - REST API
    - github.com/grandstack/grad-stakc-starter
    - also look at neo4j-examples on github
  - steps after POC
    - use marketplace image for cloud providers
    - single node instance, ~ RAM 50% of sql size on disk
    - install python for batch operations, pip neo4k-driver
    - leverage neo4j high speed driver
    - reach out to SI partner or neo4j services when stuck
  - tips
    - pull metadata of image into neo4j, not the image
    - th relationshis are the important part

- cypher sql
  - match (p1: Transaction) 0 match (p2: Transaction) p = shortestPath((p1) - [*] - (p2)) return p
  - optional match (n: P@P) - [:SENT_TO] -> (phenoe: Phone)

- questions for them
  - enterprise edition
  - what 4.0 brings
    - we need
      - Better property usage in query plan (having to project properties with WITH is cumbersome)
      - True compound indices (this is HUGE!). Basically, we can't index by (chrom, pos) as opposed to one or the other.
      - ok, so 4 (2 dev cluster, 2 prod cluster) x (16 cpus w/64GB RAM); unclear what their pricing is (by cpu or VM)
      - academic discount
  - 2-node clusters (so 4 machines: 2 dev, 2 prod). Right now each node is 16 CPUs and 64 GB of RAM
