T 9:50am - motion in apps, Britt Barack
 - @BrittBarack
  - new MotionLayout
    - replace ConstraintLayout with MotionLayout
    - other layouts need to be wrapped with MotionLayout
    
  - define the scenes
    - start scene can be keypad_down
    - end scene is kypad_up
        - same view IDs
          - rewrite constraints
    - scene_call xml file -> attaches the start and the end (both referenced there)
      - wrap data in motion_scene tag
      - this xml file will be referenced in the MotionLayout element in the layout file
      
      - <MotionScene ...>
          < Transition ...>
            <OnSwipe motion:action="dragUp"

  - what can animate
    - x, y,
    - anything else that cannot be animated (text size), need to define custom attributes
      - color,
      
  - important
    - for the motion scene, the important part is not the view, but the constratints that are
      being changed
      
    - for custom changes, define ConstraintSet for start and end
      - reference
      - the constraint sets have to have the same elements defined, although could have different values (usually will, since they are being animated)
      
  - custom attributes
    - for images
      - use crossfade attribute (?)
      - android:image
      - android:altImage (?)
      
      
    - KeyFrame
      - usually define start and end
      - can define middle steps
        - inside Transition, define KeyFrameSet
        - frame goes between 0 and 100
            <KeyFrameSet>
              <KeyAttribue motion:framePosition="50" motion:scaleX="2" motion:scaleY="2"/>
            </KeyFrameSet>

      - viewChanger.onPageChngListener()
      
  - rcap
    - create MotionLayout
    - create MotionScene
    - 
      
  - tips
    - set up lauout  - wrap with motion layout if not constraint layout element already, or else replace ConstraintLayout with MotionLayout
    - can only animate views that are direct children of MotionLayout
      - so move views out from child layout one by one as develop and test
    - define start and end scene
      - ideally do it on layouts
      - then copy paste into MotionScene
        - MotionScene
          - has transiotns
            - triggers
            - 
          - 2 consraint sets
            - keyframes
