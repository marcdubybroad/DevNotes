  - tumbor server size
    - use thi servic for image cropping
    - don't ask Picasso to do that
  - picasso pollexir module
  
  - notes
    - look at square/okhttp
    
  - new picasso will now upgrade from okhttp v2 to v3 for its networkREquestHandler )
   - since it is abstracted out, it was easy to swap out new code
   
  - square android libs
    - retrofit
    - moshi
    - wire
    - okio
    - okhttp
    - picasso
  
  

- M 4:10pm - Testing mock and, Brain Gardner, Big Nerd Ranch
  - @BrianGardnerAtl
  - test dobles
    - mocks
    - stubs
    - spies
    - dummies
    - fakes
  - test types
    - unit
      - object
    - integration
      - one particular sub system
    - end to end
      - all the system
      
  - when to use TestDoubles
    - when have indirect inputs or p=outputs
    
  - mocks
    - fit well in uni tests
    - mock is objct that records what you do to it
    - can also return data
    - 2 types:
      - lenient
        - if calls out of order from specified, not care
      - strict
        - fail if methods called out of order
        
  - stubs
    - provide data for your application
      - handle indirect inputs
    - types
      - responder
      - saboteur
        - if something goes wrong, throw exception
      - temporary
        - for TDD, coul start in prod main dir (not test dir)
        
  - spies
    - combinations for mocks and stubs
    - useful for integration tests
    
  - dummies
    - doesn't do much, there to fill ou parameter list
    - good for unit
    
  - fakes
    - replace real implementation for one better suited for testing
    - best for integration tests
    
  - libraries
    - mockito
      - does have mock obejts
      - can also ,ock interfaces
      - can add verifications on mock bejcts
    - stubs not so great
    - spies
    - dummies
    - doesn't have fakes
    
  - recap
    - don't overuse your test doubles
    - look at Fowler
    - new Kotlin book
