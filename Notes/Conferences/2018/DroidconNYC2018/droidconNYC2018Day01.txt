- M 10:40am - android animation, marcos
  - @marcospaulosd
  - motion design
  - 12 principles of animation (from Disney)
    - staging
    - slow in, slow out
    - arcs
      - animations that do arc are more naural
    -
  - disney book, "history of design"
    - google did similar project with material design
  - avoid nesting layouts
    - think like an animator
    - plan the animations ahead of time, not just after tought
    
- options
  - ObjectAnimator
    - slow due to use of reflection
  - Animation classes
    - cons: requires several instaces of AnimationSet
    - layutanimate.apply {
      duration = 1000
      
    }
  - Value Animator
  - ConstraintSet Animations
  - Motion Layout
    - subclass of ConstraintLayout
    - mix of Property Animation Framework
    - animation that helps sync objcet movements
    - need layout_start.xml
      - also need layout_end.xml
      - also need motion_scene.xml layout
        - define swipe here
          - <OnSwipe/>
    - can also resize element (image view)
    - 
  - KeyFrameSet
    - conditions on things to happen as get to set position
      - at position 0, ...
      - at position 53, ...
      - KeyAttribute xml element
        - framePosition, target, transitionEasing, curveFit, progress
      - KeyPosition
        - percentX, percentY, framePosition, target, drawPath, sizePercent, curveFit, progress
        
  - wwrap up
    - think like an animator
    - use MotionLayout for interactive motion animations
    - integrate animations well, don't just leave to the end

- M 9:50am - android studio tips, za
  - help, edit properties -> set icon for app view, for list of open project
  - style guides
  
  - put color
    - in gnerated files, so when open them, see that shouldn't mess with them
    
- helpful libraries
  - as opposed to logcat, can use pidcat
    - gets rid of logcat noise
  - adb plugin
    - pbreault/adb-idea
  - use logging interceptor if use okhttp
  - cURL inteceptor  
    - good for test builds
  - sample data library
    - custom sample data
    
- live templates
  - insert frequently used constructs in the code
    - can use this to build Toast functionality
    - also for xml file (or inside xml files)
    - code style -> templates (or live templates)
- intention actions
  - alt-enter on layout root line
  
- debugging
  - can launch app as normal, then attach debugger afterwards
  - can create shortcuts
    - can attach debugger to
    - preferences -> search for action (attach) -> link to shortcut
  - FragmentManager.enableDebugLogging(true)
    - can see ragment lifecycle messages
  - breakpoints
    - can group them
      - view them, then add them to groups
      - can then disable all of of a group at once

- debug indow
  - view  -> tools -> toll windows -> debug
  - can display values in more relevant form
  - hit cmd-shift-enter when evaluate window is open
  - benefit of watchers (watches)
    - less need to log
    - add watches to varables
  
- debugging the manifest
  - click on second tab of manifest window
  
- apk analyzer
  - helps debug the apk
  - can also compare 2 apks side by side
  
- misc
  - cmd - F12
    - shows file structure dialog
    - can find method in massive class
    - also works in manifest
  - also intellij fuzzy finder
    - start typing, find most searches
  - cmd - shift - O
    - can open any file
  - logcat
    - search bar
      - filters out based on term typed
    - cmd - F
      - only highlight matches to current term
  - column multi select
    - helps convert from one layout to another
    - alt - while highlight rows to edit
    - copy full reference of class
      - see slides
  - cmd - shift - A
    - shortcut for shortcut
  - can install key promoter
    - will always remind you of any shortcut to use
  - can also do reports of shortcuts used on android studio
  
    
- notes
  - look at the google sample topeka application
    - sample application
  - gradle build scans
