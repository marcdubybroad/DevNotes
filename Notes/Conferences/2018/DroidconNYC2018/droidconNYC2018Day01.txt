  - ConstarintSet Animations
  - Motion Layout
    - subclass of ConstraintLayout
    - mix of Property Animation Framework
    - animation that helps sync obejcet movements
    - need layout_start.xml
      - also need layout_end.xml
      - also need motion_scene.xml layotu
        - define swipe here
          - <OnSwipe/>
    - can also resize elemnt (image view)
    - 
  - KeyFrameSet
    - conditions on things to heppen as get to set position
      - at position 0, ...
      - at position 53, ...
      - KeyAttribute xml element
        - framePostion, target, transitionEasing, curveFit, progress
      - KeyPosition
        - percentX, percentY, framePosition, target, drawPath, sizePercent, curveFit, progress
        
  - wwrap up
    - think lik an anmator
