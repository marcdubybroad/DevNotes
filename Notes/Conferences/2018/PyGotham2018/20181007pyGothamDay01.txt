04:25pm - transparency in AI, Manojit Nandi, Rocketrip
- 
- weapons of math destruction, Cathy O'Neil

- LIME: Locally Intrepretable Model-Agnostic
- surrogate models
  - train a model to get the similar results to the black box model
  - can then interpretable linear model
    - use black box model as labels
  - then get answers to why model got result it did
  
  - ie:
    - get a point x with its prediction y
    - perturb point by little amount, get new y
    
- SHAP
  - SHapley Additive exPlanations
    - has root in cooperative game theoy
    
- xgboost
  - gradient boosting tree algorithm
  
- SHAPTree
- XG bosted trees

- SHAP also has deep neural net explainer: DeepExplainer

- recourse analysis
  - Ustun, Harvard SEAS
  - what can be done to data to change outcome
    - ie: if not approved for bank loan by ML engine, what can they do to switch that
    - ie: parole
  - so, if f(x) = -1, can you find action a so that f(x + a) = 1
    - what is the cheapest a
    - need to specify what are the actions tat make sense to take
      - ie: having kids to get loan is not a good idea

  - interpretable ML book - 
  


03:15pm - ML for time series
- time series
  - tima based measurements of a variable
  
- got raw ata from a kagg;e competition

- use ARIMA model
  - widely used for time series processing
  
  - assess the stationarity of the proess
    - when data oes not change
    
    - sutoregressivg
      - model that usees past to predict future
    - itegrative
    - moving average
    
- looking at bitcoin
  - data stationary
    - doesn't seem to be any seasonal tredn
    
- didn't work
  - beest when data exhibits stabe and predictive pattern
  
- prophet tool
  - developped by FB
  - opeb source
  - data doesn not hav eto be stationary
  
  
- neural networks
  - LTSM - lomg term short memory
    - ability of rtain memory cells (some long ter, some short term)
    - can use past info to proedict futur info
  - use TF library with Keras back end
  
  - doing one step ahead prediction
    - predict tomorrow based on today's
    
- comparing models
  - arima
    - data exhibits stable pattern over time
    - requires time series be stationary
  - prphet
    - on't require stationary
  - ltsm
    - act as long term and short term memory cells
    
    
    
    
    

02:45pm - gradient descent
- learning rste
  - pick < 1 so don't ping pong between 2 opposing values
    - switch direction in small increments
    
    
  

02:00pm - descriptive (descriptors)
- any method that implmrnts __method__



01:30pm - diversity data
- lessons learnied
  - people with interest and prople with tech skills in the same place
  - try to combine silo'd data
  
  
  



01:00pm - python architecture

11:15am - authy, twillio
- if alce sends to bob
  - use bob's public key to encrypt
    - only bob can decrypt
  - can also use alice's private key
    - bob can verify it came from alice

- trapdoor functions
  - have a key to reverse function
  - use really large prime numbeerx
    - like fi d prime facors of 4757
    - what about 1k digits long
    
- RSA algorithm example
  - ie: script to encrypt; all functions arr trapdoor functions
    n = p * q
    x = (p - 1) * (q -1)
    d = inverse_mode(e, x)
    
    
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange
  - alice and bob each pick a secret paint color and a common paint color
  
- elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)
  - y^2 = x^3 +ax + b

- key size
  - rsa key size of 2048 -> 112 bits of security
  - rsa 3072 -> 128 bits of security
  - ECC key size 256 -> 128 bits of security

  - 128 bits of security will keep key useful until 2030

- PKC (public key cryptoraphy) in Python
  - ie:
    public_key - private_key.public_key()
    e_message = public_key.encrypt(message)
    d_message = private_key_decrypt(e_mesage)
    
  - same with .sign() and verify()

10:45am - serverless
- fun
  - sign buddy ascii char
  - aws chalice
  
10:15am - using stylometry ML
- classifying text using ML
  - use bayes classifier
  - stylometry uses
    - blog

    - active authorization

- also kystroke analysis

- how to trick
  - breenan, afroz, greenstadt 2012 paper
  - put message through translator x 2
  
  - stylometric obfuscation
    - lessen teh frequency of stylistic markers
    
-web app
   - called 'nondescript'
   - analyzes text and suggests words to chaneg
     - provideds synonyms
