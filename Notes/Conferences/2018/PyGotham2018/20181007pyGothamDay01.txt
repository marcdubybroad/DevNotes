01:00pm - python architecture

11:15am - authy, twillio
- if alce sends to bob
  - use bob's public key to encrypt
    - only bob can decrypt
  - can also use alice's private key
    - bob can verify it came from alice

- trapdoor functions
  - have a key to reverse function
  - use really large prime numbeerx
    - like fi d prime facors of 4757
    - what about 1k digits long
    
- RSA algorithm example
  - ie: script to encrypt; all functions arr trapdoor functions
    n = p * q
    x = (p - 1) * (q -1)
    d = inverse_mode(e, x)
    
    
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange
  - alice and bob each pick a secret paint color and a common paint color
  
- elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)
  - y^2 = x^3 +ax + b

- key size
  - rsa key size of 2048 -> 112 bits of security
  - rsa 3072 -> 128 bits of security
  - ECC key size 256 -> 128 bits of security

  - 128 bits of security will keep key useful until 2030

- PKC (public key cryptoraphy) in Python
  - ie:
    public_key - private_key.public_key()
    e_message = public_key.encrypt(message)
    d_message = private_key_decrypt(e_mesage)
    
  - same with .sign() and verify()
