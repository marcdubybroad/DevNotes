LookInto
- flask or django serverless for miter apps
- 

02:40pm - customizing sphinx 
- github/pauleveritt
- PyCharm developer advaocate

- sphynx as a documentation tool
  - will create conf.y ile
  - can gnerate man pages, pdf, html
  
- sphinx parts
  - html_theme (alabaster default)
    - can configure alabaster onfig for look you want
    


02:00pm - serverless ML
- no ops suport for new project, so serverless system
  - cost scales as use
  - not managing network, security, boxes
- constrants
  - anything that runs in < 3gb ram
  -
  
- this is not to train model, but run in production

- setup
  - compute - aws lambda
  - storage - dynamodb
  - streaming - aws kinesis
  - aws gateway     ->> returns ip for newly deployed docker container?
  
- ie
  for event in event batch
    get event
    get prediction to event
    store or pass down prediction
    
- built a pipeline to deploy an dtest models
  - test to make sure not get NaN results
  
- ie:
  - goo.gl/M8vwRN
  - @gallamine
  - github/gallamine/pygotham2018-serverless-ml
  - www.gallamine.com
  
- Pywren
  - training on aws lambda
  
- lessons
  - loging extreely usefull
    - send log to s3
  - datadog good
  - audit trails to s3
  - write infrastructure as code
  - have 2 identical pipelines (test and rpod)
  - still need good code, efficient, unit tested
  - hard
    - build dependencies
      - install scikitlearn, etc onto env and porting is hard
      - so use docker when built env
    - integrating testing
    
    



01:30pm - studying graphs in spark using ML
- TPA

  - find clusters of comunities

- todo
  - download slides
  



11:15am - computing for disaster, social science
- social science requires observation
  - rely on observation
  - case studies from disasters
  
  - modeling evacuation from fires
    - case study from Station Nightclub fire i RI
    
- generalities
  - all models are flawed, but some are useful
  
- netlogo language for modeling

- what researching
  - look at what point in the fire loyalty breaks down
  

- 465 people in building designed for 252
  - 100 people perished
