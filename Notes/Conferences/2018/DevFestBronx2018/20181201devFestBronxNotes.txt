20181201 1400 - firebase ML kit, Jinn Kim @bostonandroid
  - old ml kit is now deprecated
  
  - new ML kit
    - production read
    - on devoice or cloud
    - custom models
    
  - firebase ML kit API
    - text recognition
    - face detection
    - barcode scanning
    - image labeling/landmark detection
    
  - how iti works
    - overlay
      - to help draw boxes arond things
      
  - for android
    - add deoendecies to android (manifest, build.gradle)
    - get the source image
    - set options
    - define detector
    - detectImage()
    - process resulting data

  - ex:
    // get the image
    val image = FirebaseVisionImage.fromBitmap(bitmap)
                -- or --
    val image = FirebaseVisionImage.fromMediaImage(mediaImage, rotation)

    // detector
    val options = ...
    val detector = FirebaseVision.getInstance().getVaisionFaceDetaector(options)
    
    // process
    val result = detector.detectImage(image).addOnSuccessListener { barcodes ->
        }
        .addOnFailureKitener {
        }
        
        
  - tip
    - look at other library to get image from camera
      - camera kit vs camera api
    - image resolution
      - look out fr size (no 2 MB images)
    - graphic overlay for real time
    - throttle calls
      - don't overlaod detector int he api
      
  - can also use TensorFlieLite
    - uses multi dimensal arry and graph of operations
    
    

20181201 1300 - flutter and firebase
  - hendrix talk
  - can start emulator from command line with 'flutter run'
  - look at visual studio code

        - sms text message -> twillio -> http -> microservice -> htp -> jokes google sheets
      - add db
        - sms text message -> twillio -> http -> microservice -> htp cloud sql <- jokes google sheets
          - select joke from jokes order by rand() limit 1
      - need to analyze users
        - store data from each sms with phone number and insert into bigQuery
          - bigquery is good for write once, read x times, so big data
          
      
  - twillio -> sms text message to http REST call
  
  - prices
    - cloud sql db $6 to $55 a month (postgres or mysql)
    - or nosql ($0-6 a month) - there is a free tier

20181201 1015 - cloud AI, Giorgio Natili
  - to integrate foirevase
    - imp fireabse auth, google service auth
  - twitter api
    - need consumer key and secret
    
  - aws lambda
    - .promise() -> way for s3 to return that operatino worked
    - aws rekognition
    
  - aws ML seirvice (Sagemaker)
    - hyper params
      - number layers, image shape, number of classes (that it can classify), epochs]
    - based on docker image
      - smaller containers start faster
    - supports TF    
      
  - have android jni layer that exposes the c++ to us for use/dev
