- talk 01
  - devs
    - bigquery ml
      - ML on top of bigquery
      - create a model in bigquery
        - select ... as model
    - cloud functions on GA
      - serverless compute
    - Auto ML
      - machines buidl the model for you; you provide the data
        - image based
        - natural language
      - cannot exort the model
    - Cloud composer
       - ppache airflow running on google cloud
    - Cloud build
      - service for building code
  
  - for managers
    - TPU v3 is out
    - shielded VMs
      - security key
      - Titan security key
    - access transparency
      - 
    - stackdriver service monitoring
      - monitor VMs, dishboard
    - gsuite smartness
      - smart compose, smart reply
      
  - CxOs  
    - knative
    - GKE on-prem
    - GKE serverless
      - open source serverles containers -> gwiser (imlementation of kernel)
        - adedd layer on user space on LInux
    - contact center AI
      - talk to ML agent trained on speech
      - initial call will go a to machine, then might forward to human
    - Run Oracle, SAP
      - can run on GCP
      
- talk 02, tensorflow, sam witteveen - singapore based (red dragon AI)
  - TPUs
    - tpu v1, inference only
    - tpu v2, more powerful
    - tpu v3, made to be used in pods, usually 64 together
      - example models, g.co/cloudtpu
      - reference models
        - high performance
        - open source
        - get up and running quick, then modify
    - Edge TPU
      - made for IoT
      - inference only, cannot train on them
  - what's new in TF and Keras
    - Keras, tf.keras
      - most powerful api to work wit TF
      - TF 1.9: tf.keras, tf.data, tf.eager
      - componens can be interchanged, TF optimizers
      - why kers
        - high level api of choice
        - others being phased out
      - tf.data
        - 
  - Autograph
    - converts python into TF graphs
  - autoML
    - vision
    - nlp for text classification
    - for translate
    - steps
      - load model
      - will build confisuion ,atrix (to show where model is stromg and weak)
    - problems
      - classification only
      - can be costly ($20 an hour after first free hour used)
      
  - deep learning VMs
    - deep learning image VMs
      - preemtable
    -
    
  - phones
    - apple bionic
    - qualcom
    
  - histoyr of why TPUs
    - google engineer did napkin calculation that if evey phone user used voice recog on phone
      5 mins a day, google would have to 2x their data centers
      
      
      
      
    


GDG 20160614 - Google I/O recap @ Kayak
- Announcements
  - Google VR hackathon, at MIT media lab, Columbus day 2016
  
- new Android Studio features
  - gui builder
    - has blueprint mode
  - Firebase integration
    - http://firebase.google.com
  - Espresso testing
    - a way to record a gui test that is then converted into JUnit class

  - can drop in 360 degree media in apps
    - just another media type (like video, audio, etc)
  - cardboard designed to have to hold, so can turn slower, avoid nausea
  - 

- voice access
  - for accessibility
  - also can be used for hands free work (driving, phone in pocket)
  - Espresso
    - DSL
  
- Espresso
  - part of Android support testing library

    - principal engineer
    - sr engineer, 4 days week
    - sr engineer, one day to work on what I want
- if
    - hard ot fidn other
    - start looking immediately
