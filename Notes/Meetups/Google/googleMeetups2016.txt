20190425 - aws health care
- mrna, modena therapeutics
  - process
    - old: 40 new mrna a month
    - now: 1k mRNA a ,onth
      - lots of robotics
      - 50+ informatic applications, micro servces arch
      - aws private cloud, docker containers, deployed to fargate
      
    
  - lookup
    - change nucleotide but keep protein the same
      - get different expression
    
- benchlong
  - biologics take 8% more time to dev
  - $ to develop new drug doubles every 9 years
  -
  
  - current informatic systems are built for small molecules
    - don't work for large moleciles lie biologics
    
    
- durgs
  - compunds will mutate into their lowest energy crystal forms
    - can affect how to body interects with it
    - screen ing lower risks for different crystal forms
    - molecules will rotate around all their degrees of freedom
      - will settle into their lowest energy state
    - example: 1996 hiv druge
      - new form appeared in 1998, more stable, so less body absorption
      
    -
      - zhang, wood and al - crystal growth and design 2018
      
      
- to do
  - look into the full video in 1 week
  - marketplace seller of ai models
    - sage maker, docker container,

      - inference only, cannot train on them
  - what's new in TF and Keras
    - Keras, tf.keras
      - most powerful api to work wit TF

    - qualcom
    
  - histoyr of why TPUs
    - google engineer did napkin calculation that if evey phone user used voice recog on phone
      5 mins a day, google would have to 2x their data centers
