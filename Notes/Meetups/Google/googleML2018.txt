- kiri nichol, 4th talk: paint by numbers
  - how to classify an artist, kaggle competition
  - RandomForestClassifier (finised 16th)
    - used features
      - bits per pixex area
      - pixel x / pixel y
      -
      -
  - other co petition to detect forgeries
    - orange-nejc winning algorithm
    
  - kaggle as an alternative to publishing
    - pros
      - easy to descriv what was done
      - people learn better when engaged together
      - kagglers can look over code
    - cons
      - only rewards accuracy, but algorithms speed is important too
      
      
  
      

- jasper snoek, google brain, 3rd talk: sequential reg activity using CNN
  - genome research paper: basset: learning regulatory code
    - https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/05/03/gr.200535.115.abstract
  - model of regulation of gene expression
  - genes are sequeneces of dna that encode a function
    - regulation either increases or decreases expression of genes
  - simulate wet lab experiments on the computer
  - how genes regulated
    - seqs that bind with activator proteins
    - rna polymerase
  - model
    - took out snippets of 600 nucleotides
      - 2 million seqs, 600 nuc long
      - predict cell specific dna accessibilty
         - muti task: each cell is a task
         - predict DNAse hypersensitivity
    - 164 diff cell types
    - make a vector of 4 numbers for the 4 letters
      - network design
        - 3 convolve filters, get a filter of weights
          - look for weighted conbi of sun sequence of dna
          - sldie filters over dna, get sequence of activations, one for each of the 3 filters
        - perform ReLU
        - max pool layer
        
  - in wet lab
    - take out dna
    - pour on dnase onto it
    
  - confirms the effect of known mutations
    - vitilligo: skin color issue (Michael Jackson)
    
  - how to increase and make better model
    - long range dependencies (200k nuceotides)
    - can have enhancers ad propmoters farther away than 600 nucleotide
      - enhancer and promoter can be 200k apart, but if tpuhcing can cause expression
    - may paper
      - Basenji - sequential regulatory activity prediction

  - questions
    - tried recurrent nets; didn't work for long sequences
      - so RNNs didn't work for long range
    - coyld you decinstruct NN to see what is going on
      - difficult to firgure out what is going on in the deeper layer of the neural nets
    

- dr stella lee, paradox learning, 2nd talk: AI in eLearnijgn
  - adaptive learning; individualization of
    - build student model
  - algorigthms
    - get others with subject matter experience to look oover you models and assumptions
    - algoriths can be black boxes
  - notion os 'explainbale AI'
  

- andrew berlew, 1st talk: google culture
  - google leadership study (trying to prove you don't need managers)
  - leadership attributes
    - create inclusive environment
    - empower the team
    - support career develeopment
    - be a good coach
    - be a good communicator
    - clear vision and stragegy for the team
    - be productve and results oriented
    - collaborate across google
    - be a strong decision maker
    - have key tech skill to help team
  - google approach
    - stakes: focus on the user
      - embrace all users
      - sacrifice short term interest fr user value
      - larry page 'toothbrush test'
    - ideas: think 10x
      - mediocre thinking is not welcome
    - actions: freedom to innovate
      - obsess over talent
      - celebrate success and failure
      - ex: gmail is a 20% project
  
  - AI priciples
