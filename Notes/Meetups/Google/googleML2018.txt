    - consultig for company that wants to take a TF model and create a chip for it
    - also tech, 1 day and 3 day TF course
  - hardware
    - cpu
      - do a few operations per cycle
      - tens of operations per cycle with vector extends
    - gpu
      - hundreds to thousands of operations per cycle
      - but weren't meant for ML/neural networks
      - ex: bitcoin mining, progression of hardware used over time
        - cpu -> multiple cpu -> gpu -> fpga -> asics (applifation specific instructions)
    - tpu v1
      - 128k ops per cycle, at 700mhz, 92 teraops

    - make you network smaller for edge computing
    - look for edge tpu
  

- Amira Djebbari, Scerta, AL 2nd talk: applied AI in automative
  - using TF for measuring engine issues
  - find abnormalities for transmissions
  - do multi variate time series and defect detection
  
  

- Alex Wiltschko, google, after lunch 1st talk: autograph for TF
  - look to the videos for the goog.gl link and lecture

- miki rubenstein, google, 5th talk: audio visual speech separation
  - utilize vision to process speech
    - better performing than model that just uses audio
    
  - how to train
    - take 2 clean speeches, then mix them and add backgrund noise
    - you now have yoir lbels with the clean speeches, and data to train on in the combined speech
    
  - papers (speaker dependent)
    - Hou at al, 2018

- kiri nichol, 4th talk: paint by numbers
  - how to classify an artist, kaggle competition
    - winning algorith was a CNN
  - RandomForestClassifier (finised 16th)
    - used features
      - bits per pixex area
      - pixel x / pixel y
      -
      -
  - other co petition to detect forgeries
    - orange-nejc winning algorithm
    
  - kaggle as an alternative to publishing
    - pros
      - easy to descriv what was done
      - people learn better when engaged together
      - kagglers can look over code
    - cons
      - only rewards accuracy, but algorithms speed is important too

  - model of regulation of gene expression
  - genes are sequeneces of dna that encode a function
    - regulation either increases or decreases expression of genes
  - simulate wet lab experiments on the computer
  - how genes regulated
    - seqs that bind with activator proteins
    - rna polymerase
  - model
    - took out snippets of 600 nucleotides
      - 2 million seqs, 600 nuc long
      - predict cell specific dna accessibilty
         - muti task: each cell is a task
         - predict DNAse hypersensitivity
    - 164 diff cell types
    - make a vector of 4 numbers for the 4 letters

        - 3 convolve filters, get a filter of weights
          - look for weighted conbi of sun sequence of dna
          - sldie filters over dna, get sequence of activations, one for each of the 3 filters
        - perform ReLU
        - max pool layer
        
  - in wet lab
    - take out dna
    - pour on dnase onto it
    
  - confirms the effect of known mutations

  - how to increase and make better model
    - long range dependencies (200k nuceotides)
    - can have enhancers ad propmoters farther away than 600 nucleotide
      - enhancer and promoter can be 200k apart, but if tpuhcing can cause expression

  - questions
    - tried recurrent nets; didn't work for long sequences
      - so RNNs didn't work for long range
    - coyld you decinstruct NN to see what is going on
      - difficult to firgure out what is going on in the deeper layer of the neural nets
